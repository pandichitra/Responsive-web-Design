TASK IS:

Your code should have one audio tag.
Your audio element should have a closing tag.
The audio tag should have the controls attribute.
Your code should have one source tag.
Your source tag should be inside the audio tags.
The value for the src attribute on the source tag should match the link in the instructions exactly.
Your code should include a type attribute on the source tag with a value of audio/mpeg.

Time to take a break from Camper Cat and meet fellow camper Zersiax (@zersiax), a champion of accessibility and a screen reader user. 
To hear a clip of his screen reader in action, add an audio element after the p. Include the controls attribute.
Then place a source tag inside the audio tags with the src attribute set to https://s3.amazonaws.com/freecodecamp/screen-reader.mp3 and type attribute set to "audio/mpeg".

The audio tag supports the controls attribute. This shows the browser default play, pause, and other controls, and supports keyboard functionality. This is a boolean attribute, meaning it doesn't need a value, its presence on the tag turns the setting on.

Here's an example:

<audio id="meowClip" controls>
  <source src="audio/meow.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
  <source src="audio/meow.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
</audio>
